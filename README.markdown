In-App App Store
----------------

An "In-App App Store" (IAAS) is a component you add to your iPhone/iPad apps in order to cross sell your other apps. This project provides one 
implementation of an IAAS. It features:

1.) A simple interface for creating a view controller that can be presented modally or in a popover.

2.) The content of the controller is a simple HTML page.

3.) The component first tries to load an online version of the IAAS, and if that fails falls back on a local version.

4.) Easy to drop into any project.
